// DOT NOT EDIT THIS FILE.
// it binds the actions names to what they do
// the bindings file contains the actions to keys, etc mapping

// this is lazy json (comments, missing commas). It does not evaluate against strict json
// the available contexts:
// "ctx": "ui"   - user interface javascript
// "ctx": "vlua" - active vehicle lua
// "ctx": "elua" - engine lua (async)
// "ctx": "tlua" - engine lua (sync)

// "isCentered":true has two consequences:
// first it transforms the values from 0..1 range, to -1..+1 range
// the binding settings (linearity, deadzone) are then applied on the new -1..+1 range (that is, they are applied on the center of axes values)

// "actionMap":"xxx" makes sure the binding is sent to an specific action map:
//    'Global' (highest priority): overrides lower priority bindings and CEF forwarding, no matter what (highest priority)
//    'Menu'    (medium priority): overrides lower priority bindings and CEF forwarding, if the dashboard is active (medium priority)
//    'Normal'  (lowest priority): rest of bindings

// "cat" is crossreferenced with input_categories.lua

// possible action triggers:
// "onDown"/"onUp": so far, only possible with buttons and keys
// "onChange": any change of value axes/buttons/keys
// "onRelative": relative mouse movement while holding right mouse button (with autocentering of mouse cursor)
