# Driving Research Simulator
This is an unnofficial clone of **BeamNG.Research**

BeamNG.Research is a vehicle simulator for creating self-driveing cars and the like

Some of the big files are missing, due to github limits. You will have to get those yourself, or contact me, I may be able to provide them.

I think that the big files are part of the official map, so any other map should work.
